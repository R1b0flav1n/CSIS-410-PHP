    <!--Review of Hostica-->
    <p>     Welcome to Assignment 1. Website hosing is an important aspect of maintaining a website, a choosing a reliable and trustworty host is vital. This website in particular is hosted by Hostica and provides many features and services that are useful. Hostica not only offers hosting services, but they also offer domain name purchasing, mySQL and PHP capabilities, and a very capable FTP interface.</p>
    
    <p>     There are, however, a few disadvantages to using Hostica. Althought Hostica has a very capable FTP interface, using the interface is sometimes difficult and takes a little bit of practice to maneuver successfully through all the options and folder structure. Other than that, Hostica is a very good option when it comes to hosting a website such as this one.
